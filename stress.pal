<pal script = "amq_pal_gen">
    This script sends a large number of messages to a queue and then
    reads them back.  The number of messages can be specified on the
    command-line.  Note that this fetches messages using Basic.Get,
    rather than Basic.Consume.  This is deliberately slow.  In real
    apps, please use Basic.Consume.
